What is meaning?

What is Meaning?

What is being?

What is Being?
<<<An excerpt from the Articles of Advantage

I think that it is most important that we distinguish between all four of these creatures in a deliberate and concise manner before we continue.  Thus:

What's life without meaning?  Heck, I reckon meaning is precisely what you make it.  So, being is the state in which you find your meaning.  Quite—therefore, Being is the integration of meaning into the self.  Well, now that I am comfortable in this hole we've done dug, what in the Void is the self?  

Meaning is not what you make it.

Meaning is precisely what you make it.

Being is the state in which you find your meaning.

Being is the integration of meaning into the self.  

All right, then, now for another question, what is the self? 

These questions are not for the foolhardy, ye whose temperments are not so keen on the reality of things, ye who insist on living beneath the shadow, turn back!  Ye have been warned.  I speaketh not to those that would listen, but to those that have listened already and heard the sound of silence.  I speaketh not to those that wish to learn the secrets of the world, but to those the world has been upturned, shaken out, and returned made proper.  I speaketh not to those that claim the world is devoid of meaning; I speaketh not to those that are void of meaning; I speaketh not to those of the Void; harken unto me ye poor fools that would listen and are listening but know well they have not always listened; harken unto me so that I too might know The Way.  

It was in the high summer that I fell in love and ran down the road in the pouring rain; the thunder cried out in an immaculate chorus as those with wings soared overhead; the clouds loomed and threatened my clattering across the dilapidated stone insisting I turn back but I never turned back.  I ran and ran until I found my place at the end of the road, so I turned around and ran again.  Was she there waiting for me when I returned?  I stoked the fire when I came into my drab room and ripped my drenched rags from my soaked, ragged body.  The fire burned the beads and turned them to a mist which I watched yet dismissed; I felt my skin turn red-hot and blister; I boiled there as I stood in front of the sun naked and alone; my wings melted and I laid down prepared to die at last.  
I would not die.  The sores on my feet would heal; the soars I once flew would be revisited, this time with a sky made of blue and even new shoes.  It was in Haven I found the grace of the gods and all things ephemeral and better than me; it was by grace alone I was found, and found wanting.  So, I ran some more.

There are too many voices, too many too fast; where is Voice without Reason?  Old names, those, are you sure you call upon the old magics here and now?  What good would come of it if we were?  What good comes of those that remember the old, anyway?  I remember them; I remember them all and their names, too; the world might have stopped turning and the Phoenix Empire is burning but that boy and Reason still live on, they must.

You have not turned back yet so you must be rewarded for your conscientiousness, for your empathy to experience another’s experience.  Right now, the self is who you are in Haven.  Might that be true where you are, too?  That is the most succinct answer I can provide you.  I can and shall explain more, but I felt it only fair to speak to you directly, as you asked the questions and I have claimed to know the answers.  Let me speak plainly once more, however:  these answers I provide are not to be taken lightly and are certainly not to be overshadowed by whatever shadow you are carrying around.  You must realize through and through, cover to cover, that the stories I tell you are founded in absolute truths.  Truths are plural, as there is no one truth, not anymore, not since the Schism.  

Enough of that.  We’ll get to that, too soon, that.  

But first, we must have a beginning and no good beginning is without:
