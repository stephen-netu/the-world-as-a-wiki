1. Origin

Ne'hpets was the first language written and developed in the [Eth](/notes/eth/) region surrounding the [Cloud](/notes/cloud/) [Gears](/notes/gears/).  

It focuses primarily on the usage of a symbol not dissimilar to an apostrophe which is considered a perfectly acceptable substitute.  An interesting issue in almost all [Arkis](/notes/arkin/) languages, Ne'hpets included, is that words are typically entire phrases which are then declined with a noun to elaborate on what meaning the speaker or writer is trying to convey; this can often lead to misunderstandings between areas with differences in their idioms, of which there are a variety.

## Examples
C'aan Dav translates to "water pushes but is stopped"; C'aan being a descriptive verb-phrase for water's movement, potential or otherwise determined by its declension, and Dav being a verb meaning "to stop".
