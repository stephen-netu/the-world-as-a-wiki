Raccoons host the most majestic of weddings.

It is unknown as to why of all the animals who live within the kingdoms of the [Freefolk](/notes/freefolk/) that raccoons were given sentience by the [Forge of Creation](/notes/forge-of-creation/); many scholars contend it is purely because they are the wiliest and amicable of critters-that-roam-free.  Whatever the reason, raccoons do indeed host the most majestic of weddings, and any Freefolk would be remiss to have not had raccoons take part in their wedding ceremony.
