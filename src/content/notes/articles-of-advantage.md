The Articles of Advantage (colloquially referred to as "the Articles") are likely the first series of documents to have explained the importance of self-rule, thought, and governance in civilization as a whole.  The Articles are often referred back to in an effort to improve upon (or sometimes change) governing structures.  The Articles are now kept in the [Library of C'aan](/notes/library-of-caan/), accessible only by the [PeGASuS](/notes/pegasus/).

The Articles were first authored by a series of arguments and conversations between the First Children and how they each intended to rule their Cities of Epoch.  

The following is an excerpt from the First Article:

<<<
There is but one true [Fundamental Evil](/notes/fundamental-evil/), if you were to ask me--and I dare say you do as you have requested my very essence to be forever made available on those tablets of yours--now, where was I?  Oh, yes.
<<<

As can be seen in this quote, the Articles of Advantage were transcribed by the [Words of Power](/notes/word-of-power/), [Navis](/notes/navis/), through the use of a [Grinding Tablet](/notes/grinding-tablet/).  

Regretfully, as such, the original Articles were created before proofing a stream of consciousness (via tempering either a [Nexal Mirror](/notes/nexal/) or [Abyssal Mirror](/notes/abyssal-mirror/)) was possible, so all of the First Childrens' collective thoughts were recorded and most scholars agree much had been to drink at the time of recordings.

[Oon](/notes/oon/)'s arguments were particularly spiteful and oftentimes filled with pejoratives, especially against Wicks; as such, his segments in the Articles are often most redacted, but Netu has gone on record stating that none of the Articles should ever be redacted or rewritten, as [Reason](/notes/reason/) was purest at the time of Creation and has only weakened through the millenia.
