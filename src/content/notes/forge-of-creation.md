Forge of Creation made manifest:

- [The Pinnacle of Elements](/notes/the-pinnacle-of-elements/) makes manifest the Forge of Creation from light, the [Rift](/notes/rifts/), and [Worldsong](/notes/worldsong/) and offers it to [All That Was, Is, and Can Be](/notes/all-that-was-is-and-can-be/).
- Together, [Creation](/notes/creation/) begins.
- All that Was, Is, and Can Be places the Forge of Creation at the center of [All Good Creation](/notes/all-good-creation/).
- Only [Light](/notes/light/) may enter the Forge and All That Was, Is, and Can Be chooses to never leave it.
