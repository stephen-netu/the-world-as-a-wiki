I shall say this simply:  the problem with the modern study of History is not that we are so concerned with the past, but that the past is happening all around us and we refuse to use the tools we have to fix it.  

I shall say it again in another, mouth-fuller, way:  the poor ol' lady has brought her wagon to our shop hoping we could help, as the roads are snowed in and the bridges frozen over, all but trumped, and we stare at our toolbox and first say, "Well, this is a problem of epistemology!  Let us consult the books!"  

So, we bring her to the back, to the grand ol' library, and we forget all about the car and she dies in our shop, simply of old age, and her car, out of sheer obstinacy, rolls down the hill, dilapidated, and rusts away in the Wood.  And lo!  Have I seen this!  Poor ol' boys over their tomes not even realizing if they just changed the oil, filled up the ivory tank, or even replaced some plugs...or, by the thousand hells, just gotten her a horse!  Then off the ol' woman might have went, merrily on her way after the frost let up--there might have even been a modicum of time for the books while it snowed...  Instead, no, we become rather consumed with our tools and its relation to All Good Creation.

We try our damnedest to use history to purchase a ticket to the [Nexus](/notes/nexus/) and regain some semblance of Order, but I assure you, me, that the show is happening all around you, yet, and if you go into that show you're not coming back out.  

I have seen far too many go in--they hoot and holler from inside, and boy does it sound nice, but I have seen the Shadow and its Blackgate, too, over that small slice of sanity in such an insane world if we dare even refer to Alma as such.  

Sucklin' ol' Alma is a wonderful joy until you realize that ivory glass needs to be manufactured, chickens need to be grown up to slaughter, and the Forged need to be reassembled.  

In all of my years off the tit, I shall say now in a way I probably ought to have said in all my times now of saying I was going to say anything at all--and with supreme confidence at that--after having sat in a town hall meeting or two, not a single historian or philosopher was consulted on matters on how to make the town and its peoples more wealth.

The study of history is often reviled by most due to the inconsistencies between records of all of the Cities of Epoch.  However, as with many studies, there exist those such as C'aan Dav and even, at one point or another, Netu himself who studied history for history's sake, to learn more about the World and all it has to offer.
