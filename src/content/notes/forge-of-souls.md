Once known as the Forge of Light before the events of Blackgate and the Extinction, which, while rendering the Shadow unable to annihilate the World, simultaneously equalized Light itself, so the Pale was able to enter into the Forge of Light and created a connection to the Nexus of Souls.  

As Netu remained in the Nexus for eons watching these events unfold, he had led vagrants to build a sort of staggered metropolitan area or pseudo-city almost within the Horizon itself wherein they could hold back any unseen, unknowable threats; there, Netu formed the wayfinders who, through use of the Way, were able to enter back into the World and prevent cataclysm from the ever-growing and tenacious forces of the End.
