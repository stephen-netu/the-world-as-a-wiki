Brief notes needing cleaning...  [To-do](/notes/to-do/)

- Majuscule - Mostly contained within Capital magick.  Actual world-changing stuff.
- Major - Changing the weather.  Summoning elementals.  You know, magick stuff.
- Minor - Throwing a fireball kind of stuff.
- Miniscule - Mostly cantrips.  Pulling a rabbit out of a hat type stuff.
- Infinitesimal - Things that have magick, but seemingly does not much.
