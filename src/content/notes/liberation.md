1. Liberation

Just prior to the events of the [Covenant of Shadow](/notes/covenant-of-shadow/) rifts form from within All That Was, Is, and Can Be, as well as from whatever detritus, debris, and remnants of the cataclysms of colliding Elementals and Evils from the ongoing [End War](/notes/end-war/).

The Shadow formed in secret from the rifts thereafter; this is unknowingly the first [Covenant](/notes/covenant/).

As the End War began to reach its conclusion, the Forge of Creation was made manifest by the [Pinnacle of Elements](/notes/pinnacle-of-elements/) from light, whatever rifts were tenable, and even the Worldsong, some scholars contend.  The Pinnacle offers the Forge to All That Was, Is, and Can Be; together, [Creation](/notes/creation/) began.
