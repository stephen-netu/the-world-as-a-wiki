1. Discord's Origin

Discord's origin is not entirely known, even by the [Chronomancy](/notes/chronomancer/)'s discoveries, but it is commonly believed that Bedlam used discordant tones from the Worldsong and manifested Discord; however, it is unknowable how Bedlam interacted with the Worldsong directly as this has never been recorded in the annals of the World.

1. [War of the Song](/notes/war-of-the-song/)
The Fundamental Forces themselves battled for dominance and power over one another.  [Elementals on High](/notes/elementals-on-high/) were sang into existence by the Worldsong but were almost immediately overtaken by the Fundamentals, culminating in the [Horizon](/notes/horizon/), which gave credence and power to the rising [Fundamental Evils](/notes/fundamental-evils/).
