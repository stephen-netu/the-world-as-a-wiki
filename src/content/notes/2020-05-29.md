**22:21**~Murmur was a chief alchemist for the Ruus.  Nothing is known about her, her history, family, past, anything, because as Nianis was sealed in the Forge of Dragons through sheer godliness/force of will he erased everything about her since he could not actually destroy her.  Ironically, this worked out to her benefit in the end... <br />
