One of the last [Wayfinders](/notes/wayfinders/).  Lived during the [Epochs](/notes/epoch-of-serenity/).  Died during [Murmur](/notes/murmur/)'s final reckoning in which the [Void](/notes/void/) ceased [The Real](/notes/the-real/), ending existence.

Was known to be an inventor of games, specifically those that could be played among friends and with [Grinding Tablet](/notes/grinding-tablets/); his ultimate creation was an extraordinarily advanced card game.
