1. Form and Origin
All Good Creation is quasi-celestial being not dissimilar to the Pinnacle of Elements in both purpose and form.  

However, instead of being comprised of Elementals, gears, and their requisite counterparts belonging to the End, All Good Creation was manifested through the works of Liberation, All That Was, Is, and Can Be, and ultimately Creation itself.  

Notably, Liberation and Creation were freed and made manifest by Liberation and Creation respectively, and all of these constituent parts of All Good Creation are believed to be what led to the foundation of [Order](/notes/order/) as it is known today.

## Singers' notions of All Good Creation's godliness or right to supremacy
All Good Creation is referred to by orthodox [Singers](/notes/singers/) as [Lord God](/notes/lord-god/) or [God Liberator](/notes/god-liberator/) and the Worldsong as [Holy Mother of Gods](/notes/holy-mother-of-gods/), [Mother Creator](/notes/mother-creator/), [Mother Spirit](/notes/mother-spirit/) or, more simply, [Worldsong](/notes/god/) and [God Herself](/notes/god-herself/).  

Most other religions do not perceive All Good Creation as taking an active interest in the goings-on of the World's peoples, but most do give credence to it at least for the creation story as has been provided by the [Chronomancy](/notes/chronomancers/) of the [Nir Empire](/notes/nir-empire/).

1. Events leading to the culmination of All Good Creation ([To-do](/notes/to-do/))

- Liberation - The End War ends - The [Pinnacle of Elements](/notes/pinnacle-of-elements/) is formed from the remaining [Elementals on High](/notes/elementals-on-high/) who survive the [War of the Elements](/notes/war-of-the-elements/) and ongoing [End War](/notes/end-war/).
- The Pinnacle of Elements is the first quasi-celestial planar Being.	
- Bedlam excised from Chaos	- Bedlam is banished outside of Chaos and All Good Creation; Bedlam unknowingly succumbs to the Void but does not comprehend the not.  
- Only Discord and Cacophony remain in the End within Chaos.	
- Light liberated - With [Bedlam](/notes/bedlam/) banished, Light is freed from [Chaos](/notes/chaos/) and the remnants of the elemental remnants of the End.  
- With Light liberated, All That Was, Is, and Can Be is Being.	
- All That Was, Is, and Can Be	Covenant of Shadow	Rifts form from All That Was, Is, and Can Be, as well as from the detritus, debris, and remnants of the cataclysms of colliding Elementals and Evils from the End.
- The Shadow forms in secret from the rifts.  This is unknowingly the first Covenant.	
- Creation - [Forge of Creation](/notes/forge-of-creation/) made manifest - The Pinnacle of Elements manfiests the Forge of Creation from light, the rifts, and Worldsong and offers it to All That Was, Is, and Can Be; together, Creation begins.	
- [All That Was, Is, and Can Be](/notes/all-that-was-is-and-can-be/) places the Forge of Creation at the center of All Good Creation; only Light may enter the Forge and All That Was, Is, and Can Be chooses to never leave it.	
- Time forms - Time *is *as the Worldsong is makes manifest a rhythm and gains its particular cadence due to the works of All Good Creation.  
- Along with Time and Light, the Forge of Creation ignites and All Good Creation announces triumphantly...
