There was a time before.  

I do not know how to describe it.  I have never been able.  I do not know what words to use or even how it makes me feel--in fact, I think I feel nothing, but I know what I know.  

It began a long time ago, some of my first memories are of it, in fact; I would lay beside my mother dearest and suckle her tit; it was there, at her side, aloft and serene, I would find the [Void](/notes/void/).

"Boy," spoke the old, grizzled once-[Spellslinger](/notes/slinger/), "Your mother was a dragon and these hills are yours if you take them."  He thought I could not hear him, but I heard the spell he cast over me when he picked me up; of course, I did not yet know how to speak, so I could not let him know that already I felt the [Thunder](/notes/thunder/); I knew that I would wield it.  I do not know how I know these things.

*I do not know how I know.*

***But I do.***

There was a time before.  [Time](/notes/time/) now slumbers, [Keystone](/notes/keystone/) all but destroyed; the [Necromancy](/notes/necromantic/) threat abated, forgotten, but not entirely concluded.  

There was a time in [The Real](/notes/the-real/), here and now, much like that time before, but [Time](/notes/time/) there stood in [The End](/notes/the-end/), not here, not in this [The World](/notes/world/).

I do not know how I know Time before, but perhaps he wanted to make himself known; who am I to question the primordial essences of [All That Was, Is, and Can Be](/notes/all-that-was-is-and-can-be/), after all; yet, to even mention their names, this way, in this manner--it is all quite for nothing, is it not?  

I am trying to recount my earliest memories; I am trying to go back there.  I hear water dripping and then it stops, but it drips still, but it is stopped--not just the sound of the drip, drip, drip, drop--the water, the very water from the tap, it is stopped, there, hanging just so...  I reach out and it screams in agony; Time screams in agony.  I feel it.  I feel all of it at once; the Real reaches out and grabs hold of me.  I open my eyes.  

"Are you OK?" the [Gymir](/notes/gymir/) asked in a plain, rather uninvolved voice, "You are paler than I'm used.  Maybe you hairless [Free Folk](/notes/folken/) are always that color though in this light?"  She was asking a question, but not one I would answer even if I were equipped to in my current state.  I grimaced and sighed--not an abnormal response--and she took foot around the path to collect more...

...More water.  I looked at her and saw through her; I saw Time there and he beckoned me to wind the path myself, to find wind behind me still, stilled my nerves and my future unknowable, untenable, because right now there was everything and nothing; right now time simply was not.  I walked past her and she did not move; nothing moved; nothing could move.  I walked on up the path and smiled; I do not know why.

[The Way](/notes/the-way/) has a way about it, truly.  It is not an energy source or anything that *gives power* in one instance or another; it does not take or remove or destroy or have an objective.  It, in fact, should not be spoken of as a noun at all, really.  The Way is a practice; much like math, the numbers themselves hardly matter and what you discover by putting them together is precisely the point.  Of course, some perform math for math's sake; some just like watching numbers.  I just liked watching, too, and I think that is why I spent so much time between the Real and the Void; why I find myself even now walking between the everything and the nothing, why I find myself enraptured with the idea that there is nothing else other than precisely what we make of it.  

When the water started again I was too busy counting the leaves on the clovers.  Time smiled and had already left, but I do know that he was giddy; at long last there would be one to lead the [Vagrant](/notes/vagrants/).  Time did not exactly have much power in a world where [Chronomancy](/notes/chronomancy/) was sealed behind a [Forges](/notes/sun/).  I pointed up at the sky at her and asked, "Why did you choose to take it all from us?  We could have had it all, couldn't we?  The World is ours, is it not?"  She ignored me; she always did.  The [Pale Moon](/notes/pale-moon/) hung there in the sky so I called her by the only name I knew:  "[Alma](/notes/alma/), why have you forsaken us?"  She would not answer; she never did.  She stayed right where she always would, there, Time apparently by her side yet I knew different, did I not?  I knew, at least, that while he might have been locked away I was here--and now--ready to do exactly what I had to.

I was going to save the World.  No, no, perhaps that is a silly thing to say let alone to believe.  

I would end Time; I would lead the vagrants to Haven.  It was here, in this World, in the Real.  I knew it and I would find it.  The [Wayfinders](/notes/wayfinders/) would find it; they would lead others there.  Those trapped in [The Abyss](/notes/the-abyss/) would not suffer much longer; the [Brink](/notes/brink/) and all its nexal magicks would be ours for the taking--and with them Time would not matter--I would undo all that Alma had wrought.  I swear this, I spoke, there, under that water dripping from the tap at the well.

I swear that I will lead the vagrants.  I swear that I will undo what Alma has done.  For better or worse, I swear all of this.  I had the thunder; I would have my staff, too.  There was another, though, one I should have feared--then, I should have feared, assuredly, but not yet so much (what a young, foolish boy I was, wasn't I?)...  

It was there at [Hope Mountain](/notes/hope-mountain/), almost at its summit, that I heard nothing at all for the first time.  I saw into the horizon, beyond this world of [Gears](/notes/gears/) and machination, and I saw naught but [Void](/notes/void/).  I knew then--as I know even now--she was there, biding Time, and would be upon us before my mission was finished.

I would need more time; I would need more souls; I would need to betray everyone I loved for the sanctity of not only [Hope City](/notes/hope-city/) itself, but for the entire World, from Cloud to Ash, from Sand to Snow.

There was a time before.  Before all of this.  Before betrayal and immortality for those unwilling, uncaring, unable, or all three.  There was time even before the [Watchers Three](/notes/watchers-three/), too, but to speak of universes long dead, gobbled up by mere entropy, what a chore--worlds I know nothing about and have no patience for.  I am here and I am now; the Real asks me if I shall welcome it and my arms, first akimbo, extend patiently to allow it to suckle upon my tit.  It is there, All That Was, Is, and Can Be, too, from [Order](/notes/order/) and Void and [Chaos](/notes/chaos/)...  Even [Eknav](/notes/eknav/), he, too...  They are all there, upon my tit, and we float there in the endless nothingness my sheer willpower the milk which sustains.  They take it and grow, but how large!  Their very bodies begin to fill the nothingness and it constrains me...I cannot hold them!  No longer!  They pull away and blood fills the space between us; my chest is torn in two, from stem to stern I am rended; they are no more.

*I open my eyes.*

"My name is [Netu d'iel Nari](/notes/netu-diel-nari/) and I know the Way."
