"Send him through."  "Aye, sir."  Immaculate light tore through the sky and filled the empty space between the two [Pylon](/notes/pylons/).  A man in chains stepped forward once of his own accord, if he had such a thing still, but then stopped.  

"Push him," spat someone wearing a golden suit of armor with a winged, metallic [Armor Types](/notes/manteau/).  A woman wearing similar armor, silver and heavier with chained leggings, heaved once and shoved the chained man; he did not budge but turned and faced his captors.

"This is not the [The End](/notes/end/)," he stated but did not inquire, yet was still answered in turn:  "It is yours, fool, now begone with you!  Speak your riddles no more!"  The golden man lifted a hammer and pointed it toward the exile-to-be, "I said begone!"  A beam of [Astral](/notes/astral/) energy shot from the hammer's tip and collided into the chained man, knocking him back between the pylons.  

His [Being](/notes/being/) was no more; he dissolved into the not; no one heard anything more other than the closing of the [Gate](/notes/gate/)...  Except for the one who wore silver, the one who had been ordered to shove the now-[The Exile](/notes/exile/); she had heard the exile's words and stated them loudly and clearly for all to hear:

<<<.tc-big-quote
"For kindness is always a going out of the [Void](/notes/void/) into the Void, a valiant pushing back against the not."
<<<

The golden man snarled, spat, and struck her down in a singular blow.  She fell over with tears on her cheeks, but not because of any pain she had felt for she had felt none, except knowing that the [The World](/notes/world/) was in grave danger.
