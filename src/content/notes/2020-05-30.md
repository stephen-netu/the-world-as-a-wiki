**13:22**~Forges as suns?  Forge of Souls (to be renamed) was used to do necromancy (Brink magick!).  Then Forge of Dragons (rename this!) was used to use highest level Axiom/Capital (using ichor from Nianis) to make the anti-Reason bomb?'<br />**16:06**~Nianis sealed in Forge of Dragons and Murmur (and gang) uses his ichor to create Anti-Reason weapons to siege the other Forges? <br />**16:54**~[Murmur](/notes/murmur/) betrayed [Nianis](/notes/nianis/) by sealing him within the [Forge of Dragons](/notes/forge-of-dragons/). <br />**16:54**~[Nianis](/notes/nianis/)' followers were the developers of the [Anti-Reason Bomb](/notes/anti-reason-bomb/), believing that through his undying rage ([Wrath](/notes/wrath/)) <br />**16:54**~The bomb was created because of the rising [Necromancy](/notes/necromantic/) threat from [Keystone](/notes/keystone/) but its use was **subverted** at that time. <br />**16:54**~The bomb *was used, however,* in the destruction of [Arkis](/notes/arkis/), which led to the creation of [Arkis II](/notes/arkis-ii/) and [Arkis III](/notes/arkis-iii/), two cities built atop one another in [Eth](/notes/eth/). <br />**16:54**~The [Forge of Souls](/notes/forge-of-souls/) was being used to raise the dead as an army to march against the [Citadel of White Shores](/notes/citadel-of-white-shores/). <br />
