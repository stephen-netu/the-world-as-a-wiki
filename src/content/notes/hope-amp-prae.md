The Hope & PRAE, also known as Prae or PRAE, is a [Keystone](/notes/keeper/) located in Hope City

PRAE is an initialism for:  Parallel Returns Associated Exchange.

PRAE was first created in the writings of the philosopher-druid, [Temark the Scoundrel](/notes/temark-the-scoundrel/), whose interest in both [Marks](/notes/marks/) and finances went hand-in-hand.  Temark had written:

<<<
Every single thing, I refer to them as *eaches*, has been counted thrivetimes by those I employ; I sought whom to do no harm insomuch as I only requested audits, counting, and of course meticulous and precise documentation, but, as with such things, those that wished to call upon the Shadow got precisely what they wrought and we counted all the same.  

I would build a great inventory--not of things I owned, O! no, that would be far too much real work.  Instead, I have set out to trade the things of others; after all, what are these things for if not but means to make those who ought to be rich precisely thus?
<<<

Almost all of his works and documents were lost in [Freedom Fire](/notes/freedom-fire/) of [Freeport](/notes/freeport/), where almost all of his fortunes were housed in a series of shoreline warehouses; however, of those that did remain, scholars are in agreement that Temark's works were, in fact, what led to the creation of various exchanges across the known World of the time, including the emergence of the Keepers' first exchanges, and eventually Hope & PRAE itself.
