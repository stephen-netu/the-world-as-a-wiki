You may know them here much to your dismay: Bedlam, Cacophony, and Discord–together, Chaos–all be damned!
<<<To my nihilist benefactor...

The Fundamental Evils are comprised of primordial anti-beings; there are countless arguments on whether the Evils themselves are quasi-celestial as their [Pinnacle of Elements](/notes/pinnacle-of-elements/)' Elemental counterparts, but it is simply unknowable even as the Evils make themselves known unto the World.

The three primary Evils which rule over [Horizon](/notes/horizon/) and continue to seize and inflict tyranny upon the End are Bedlam, Discord, and Cacophony.
