Gallantly and plainly the grave-robbers toiled<br>
To he the spade held above his head<br>
Twas a simple query not asked but said<br>
They spoke not silently into that night<br>
Motionless and still dirt set right<br>
Arrangements undone and unmade thus instead

The corpse revealed itself shriveled and soiled<br>
“Is this the first upon which ye’ve turnt?”<br>
“Aye, ‘tis, a grave d’iel mother’s whose house burnt.”<br>
That was not the query not the first<br>
For it was this gentleman here who pulled the hearse<br>
The spade chipped a lock-box they soon learnt<br>

The grave-robbers plans were too soon foiled<br>
The contents of the box splayed out for them to see<br>
Even the ol’ cadaver looked on in wicked misery<br>
The query the first was said again for he to hear<br>
He said to the other, “Do ye have not fear?”<br>
Revealed in the contents there was the silver key<br>

The mother’s bastard in that house fire had boiled<br>
Tar from the roof dripped down into the crib<br>
Buried the babe from stern to rib<br>
The boy’s legs warped in placid flame<br>
A silver key etched his whore-mother’s name<br>
Now found--behind the men there loosed a squib<br>

Those who sent the shot did not tarry and roiled<br>
“Begone, ye heathens, this is a place of mourning!”<br>
The shot was meant first as but a warning<br>
Yet the bastard’s legs placid as that flame<br>
So the others ran but did holler his name<br>
Twas the guardsmen however they were informing<br>

The entire plan all along uncoiled<br>
“The bastard burnt whose whore-mother’s grave was upturning,”<br>
Started the fat hatted beard of a man discerning<br>
“This key her name upon which is engraved<br>
For this alone ye have in this way behaved?”<br>
“Twas, sire, for I am he, the boy who was left burning.”<br>

“This key, however, was buried fast and locked away.<br>
Tis not yours, not today.”<br>
“Sire, you do not understand—what she has become…”<br>
“Silence, heathen, your gods shall succumb!”<br>
Flame surrounded the boy to his dismay.<br>

The fat hatted beard of a man had not soon enough recoiled.

This is the story of the boy who was left to die by a placid flame; a flame that ate up a house, a mother, a poor dog—perhaps a donkey, too, but it was not proved—oh, and a tree, a barn, and, of course, the boy, all the same.  The fire burnt and burnt gently into that night, yet, the boy lived on, somehow, but twas the poorest sight.  The boy’s legs crippled and unused, placid as that flame; he would live his life unfortunate and lame.  He was thought to be simple and naive yet soon it was told that the boy’s mother was a goddess of the old world long before; the guardsmen would laugh and of course lock him away, but just as he had been born by flame…

Well, I should not go on, not in this way.  The story was to be written as the above, not as prose, this paragraph too mundane.
