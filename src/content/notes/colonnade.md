The Colonnade was created from the [Pinnacle of Elements](/notes/pinnacle-of-elements/) to determine the meaning and purpose for each [Gears](/notes/gear/) created.

Before [Time](/notes/time/) itself *was*, the [Gods](/notes/gods/) not only disagreed on form and function of the [The Real](/notes/real/).  As there was no [Congruence](/notes/congruence/) among the first gods, the [The Shadow](/notes/shadow/) subverted not only them, but the [Pinnacle of Elements](/notes/pinnacle-of-elements/) as well as [All Good Creation](/notes/all-good-creation/), too.  These events eventually led to the [Schism of the Gods](/notes/schism-of-the-gods/), the first [Schisms](/notes/schism/).

The Colonnade encompasses six [Columns](/notes/columns/) each with their own [Denomination](/notes/denominations/).  The Colonnade itself rests below the [Entablature](/notes/entablature/) which holds [The World](/notes/the-world/) not only in its place, but also as a sort of filter to ensure no [Being](/notes/being/) from the Colonnade can immediately and directly interact with the World itself.  

Each column is a direct [Gate](/notes/gate/) from [The World](/notes/the-world/) to the [The End](/notes/end/) by way of the [Astral](/notes/astral/).   Columns are typically governed by some kind of deity which may or may not be known to the peoples of the World; however, some columns are left [Schisms](/notes/schismatized/) with no direct rule from any singular [Being](/notes/being/).

During certain [Epochs](/notes/epochs/) they have been known to manifest themselves into the World for better or worse.

1. Ascension

Not all gods were created of [All Good Creation](/notes/all-good-creation/) or from the [The End](/notes/end/).  Some gods rose into [Being](/notes/being/) as mortals by deriving [Purpose](/notes/purpose/).
