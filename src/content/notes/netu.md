<<<[Eknav](/notes/eknav/), pre-Ascension

Love does not exist except for in the High Summer, when all three suns have their longest stay in the firmament; some worlds have Monsoon, others Autumn, and some even a Dark Winter, but all worlds relish in the High Summer.  The gear of Ash, that is the world of Ash itself, however, suffers a summer cursed forever Pale, brought about by that Schism, when Voice spoke up and said the wrong thing, led All Good Creation to the wrong decision, and inadvertently yet quite purposely loosed an empire into Haven; from there, the rest is history, as the world tree fell and with it the sky, what we might call continents were created but gears they remain, like clockwork upon the World Engine which spurns on All Good Creation, even in its darkest hour--and all the while, the Watchers watched and those who worked for a living worked.  

The story would be about a boy without Reason, a boy who all along thought he was righting wrongs but made such a grievous mistake the World would never be the same.

He, d'iel Nari, of the Black, Voice was made:  exiled to the Void, to the not.  

That is the story, where the Exile, spoken to by horned creatures rightly named (incidentally, there be three devils, not named in these short snippets, but you may know them here much to your dismay:  Bedlam, Cacophony, and Discord--together, Chaos--all be damned!); the poor boy was led through a dark forest only to, in thousands of years, come out the other side with nothing but a stick in one hand and the thunder in the other:  a wizard, some might call him, others a prophet, but truly a leader who only wanted folks to live simply without having to fight a war without Purpose; he was a leader who wanted folks to find Meaning where there was not.


```
No currying favor; no pandering.  Never vulgar.
Self-reliance, strength, perseverance, self-control.  
No one ever called him glib, shameless, or pedantic.  Unconvinced by flattery.
Ability to feel at ease with people.
Willingness to yield the floor to experts and support them energetically.  
Not prone to go off on tangents; fresh and at the top of his game.
He looked to what needed to be doing and not the credit to be gained for doing it.
