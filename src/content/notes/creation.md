## Forward from the Alchemist-Philosophers of the Gates

Here below and begins with pen and sword be the [Word of Epoch](/notes/word-of-epoch/); held within are naught but riddles of matters surrounding ontological fixation and things entirely metaphysical and quite nonsensical.  To begin would be to end and all matters of the End are held within, too, you see, for these are not just words but *the word*; what you now read is not just a story of how we came to be but how we are *to be*.

1. Creation

All that Was, Is, and Can Be placed the Forge of Creation at the center of All Good Creation; only [Light](/notes/light/) may ever enter the Forge and All That Was, Is, and Can Be has chosen to never leave it.

[Time](/notes/time/) was thus made manifest.  Time ***is *** as the Worldsong manifested a rhythm and gained its particular cadence due to the works of All Good Creation.  Along with Time and Light, the Forge of Creation ignited.  All Good Creation together triumphantly announced...

<<<.tc-big-quote
"Yours is the World.  I have created you so that All That Was Has Been, Is, and Will Be, to create Order where there is naught but Chaos, and revel in Light where there is only the End.  You are my child; I am but naught and you are my All."
<<<All Good Creation

1. ~~Beginning of the Creation of the World~~
### *"In the beginning..."  "No, no, no, not like that!"*

1. Once Upon a Time...

- Countless gears were forged.  The Forge of Creation was used to create thousands upon thousands of gears--some are without purpose or meaning, with some being discarded back into the End.
- Time begins	
- The World Engine is forged and set atop the Forge of Creation for All to witness.  The World Engine turns the gears.  Time now moves forward.
- Beginning of the Capital Era	
- Colonnade founded	
- The Colonnade is created from the Pinnacle of Elements to determine the meaning and purpose for each gear that is created.
- Elementals of the Highest Order chosen	
- The most ancient and wisest Elementals on High are chosen to act as the Elementals of the Highest Order within the Colonnade - these Beings are the first of the proto-deities.  
- The World is	
- The gears are given meaning into Being; as such, Meaning is made manifest.  The World is.
- Time intermittent	
- Rifts continue to form and gears are lost within them; the World Engine slows and time becomes intermittent.
- The gears flow through time unpredictably and not even the gods themselves can set their course deliberately.  Meaning without purpose.
- Beginning of the Schism of the Gods	
- The Shadow subverts All Good Creation	
- The Shadow, having remained unknown, has grown in power and sets upon the World from behind the rifts.
- The Shadow turns the Elementals of the Highest Order against one another using the Fundamentals.  Several of the Highest Order betray one another or cease in Being.
- Entablature founded
- For its protection, the World is placed upon the Entablature which is placed upon the Colonnade by the Elementals of the Highest Order.
- Epoch of Ascension	War for the Colonnade begins	
- The gears are used as battlegrounds for the celestial Beings who wish to seize a place in the Colonnade.
- Ascension manifests	
- The Elementals of the Highest Order let those with Meaning ascend to the Colonnade to replace them; this is regarded as one of the ultimate acts of Reverence by All Good Creation.
- War for the Colonnade ends 	Six gods each take their place in the Colonnade and each maintain deliberate control over literal, actual-celestial planar Being; all other gods are bound to the End.
- End of the Schism of the Gods	
- The gods leave the World	
- The Colonnade is separated from the Entablature as Bedlam returns to Chaos from the Void.  The gods reunite and defend Chaos and Bedlam from entering into the World.
- End of the Capital Era		
- Those with Meaning can no longer witness the gods at will, but the gods can make themselves known; denizens of the World begin to actively worship all of the gods.
