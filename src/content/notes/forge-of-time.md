Alma takes hold of the Forge of Time and this sets the Pale Sun in its place forever.

After the Nir Empire fell, it was strongly believed that the Forge of Time was rendered completely inert; however, with the return of the Elite who warned Netu of Murmur's siege upon Hope City, it was evident there were still chronomancers able to create some sort of link with the Forge in some manner.  

Netu, ironically, did not have time to discuss with the Elite as to how his powers were made manifest, but the evidence was clear and the Prophecy had not been fulfilled by Eknav as had been presumed for nearly a millennium.
