The War for White Shores was the first [The Abyss](/notes/abyssal/) siege after [MÃ¶jo](/notes/mjo/)'s construction of the [Gneiss](/notes/gneiss/), [Netu](/notes/netu/)'s flagship.

[Keystone](/notes/keystone/) had been riddled with [Ivory](/notes/ivory/) fallout after the [Citadel of White Shores](/notes/citadel-of-white-shores/) had loosed one of the first ever created [Anti-Reason Bomb](/notes/anti-reason-bombs/) upon it.  The remaining [Gymir](/notes/gymir/) of Keystone had rallied in its sub-levels and there had begun diligent work upon creating [Yscraft](/notes/yscraft/) of varying types.  The three most powerful yscraft, the Gneiss (flagship), the Promise Breaker (frigate), and Rose (gunboat) were able to breach White Shores' primary defenses for the first time in history and allowed for the demolition of [Ruus](/notes/ruusic/) anti-reason inventory.
