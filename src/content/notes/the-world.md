I do not think or stand to posit that a thinking thing's first question might be what it is or who it might be; no, in fact, I think a thinking thing's first question might be in regards to what the World itself might be and how it, as a thinking thing, might take advantage of it.

The [Articles of Advantage](/notes/articles-of-advantage/) were first published by [Oon](/notes/oon/) shortly after the [War for White Shores](/notes/war-for-white-shores/).
