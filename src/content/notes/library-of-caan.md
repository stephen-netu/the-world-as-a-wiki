The Library of C'aan was created by [C'aan Dav](/notes/caan-dav/), for whom the library is now titular.  

During C'aan's life, the library was known only as the Knowledge Shop but his brother-in-law, [H'run](/notes/hrun/), continued C'aan's efforts after his demise, even going as far as to take a large loan out from [Bil Olney](/notes/bil-olney/) of [MÃ¶r](/notes/mr/) for further renovations and the construction of the Secular Wing.

1. The Secular Wing

C'aan always hosted a plethora of religious [Grinding Tablet](/notes/grinding-stones-and-tablets/) but rarely were any truly secular writings or recordings stored in the library at first.  At C'aan's deathbed, he requested H'run to take over the shop and to do with it as he pleased--he was sincere and all his family and friends knew as much.  H'run, being a staunch defender of [Reason](/notes/reason/) for Reason's sake, almost immediately took to the construction of the Secular Wing for housing all of the great works created without consideration for the goings-on of the [Colonnade](/notes/colonnade/).
